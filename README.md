### Setup

Spice Bot needs a reverse proxy set up to work. In **nginx**, your config should include something like this:

```nginx
location /twitch/ {
  proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  proxy_read_timeout 86400;
}
```

The Discord bot requires only these permissions to function:

- Manage Roles (to assign notice roles)
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
- Mention @everyone, @here, and All Roles (**only** to ping the notice roles)

The bot does not require any privileged intents.

### Start

Build Spice Bot with `npm run build` and start it with `npm start`. I recommend using a service such as [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to handle auto-restarts and log files.
